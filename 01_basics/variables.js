const accountId = 12345//cant be changed
let accountEmail = "jk@1234"
//these 2 are good methods of variable assignment

var accountPw = "345JK" //var is not used nowadays bacz of block scope and functional scope
accountCity = "cuttack" // not recommended but can be done
let accountName

//accoutId = 33555 shows error for changing
console.log(accountId);

accountEmail = "jks@gmail.com"
accountPw = "123jpjp"
accountCity = "BBSR"
console.log(accountEmail);// shows error why??? 
console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPw, accountCity, accountName])
